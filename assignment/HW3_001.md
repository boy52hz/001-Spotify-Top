# Assignment 3 (Group)
From week 4 that you have using dpylr packages and learn from self learning activity. I want you to review and improvement your group assigment 
#2. Rewrite your function by using dpylr at least 5 topics (from 2 datasets). Your group can add new topics to reach 5 topics.

### Answer

1.) From cats, average of height cats is 10.63056 .

Normal : 
```{R} 
colMeans(subset(cats,select=c(Hwt)))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
cats %>% summarise(Hwt = mean(Hwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```

2.) From cats, average of body weight is  2.723611 .

Normal : 
```{R}
colMeans(subset(cats,select=c(Bwt)))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
 cats %>% summarise(Bwt = mean(Bwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```

3.) From cats, average body weight of  female cat  is  2.359574 .

Normal : 
```{R}
colMeans(subset(cats[1:47,],Sex=="F",select =c(Bwt))))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
cats %>% filter(Sex=="F") %>% summarise(avg= mean(Bwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```

4.) From survey, the youngest student  is 16.75 years old.

Normal : 
```{R}
apply(subset(survey,select=c(Age)),2,min) 
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
survey %>% summarise(min=min(Age))
```

5.) From survey, max Age is 73 years old .

Normal : 
```{R}
max(subset(survey,select=c(Age)))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
survey %>% summarise(max=max(Age))
```

6.) From survey, the data include 50 men over 19 years old .

Normal : 
```{R}
count(subset(survey,Sex == "Male" & Age > 19))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
survey %>% tally(Sex=="Male"& Age > 19)
```

7.) From survey, the average of pulse that people tall more than 170 is 73.48352 . 

Normal : 
```{R}
mean(((subset(survey, Height > 170 ))$Pulse),na.rm=TRUE)
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
survey %>% filter(Height>170) %>% summarise(avg= mean(Pulse, na.rm = TRUE))
```

8.) From survey, the number of  people that smoke heavy is 11 .

Normal : 
```{R}
 count(subset(survey,Smoke == 'Heavy'))
```
Use dplyr :
```{R} 
survey %>% tally(Smoke=="Heavy")
```
